# Machine-learning
This project aims to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. The dataset used for this project consists of sonar signals bounced off different objects in the ocean. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether the object is a rock or a mine.
The classification task is approached using Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification problems. Logistic Regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.
#Project Structure:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of data and preprocess it for modeling.
Model Development: Logistic Regression model is implemented using Python's scikit-learn library.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model are provided, including any dependencies required.
#Requirements:
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
